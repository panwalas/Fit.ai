## The problem Fit.ai solves

```
The application can be used by people who get less time to
exercise or mostly have a desk job. They can use it have a
refreshing exercising sprint in a break. The app can also provide
assistance to older people who want to do light exercises and
can also be helpful to people going through a rehab.
```
## Challenges we ran into

```
Deciding the right exercises and identifying them using computer
vision was huge task. We generated the co-ordinate data which
was used to create conditions for various exercises. Finding the
correct framework was also a challenge.
